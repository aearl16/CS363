# CS363
Information Security and Assurance

  Note: This information is also relevant for IS435 under the same name.

This Repo contains all of the work, assigments, and study guides from CS363 Information Security and Assurance. As soon as possible I will do a tutorial for lab two which was one of the most difficult labs for that class. Hope this helps whoever reads this.
